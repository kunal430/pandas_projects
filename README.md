# Pandas Projects: Exploring and Analyzing Data with Python

This repository showcases a collection of Python projects using the Pandas library for data analysis and manipulation. Each project demonstrates various Pandas functionalities, from basic data cleaning to more advanced analysis techniques.

üöÄ Learning Focus:

These projects were designed to solidify my understanding and practical application of Pandas, covering key concepts such as:

*   **Data Loading and Reading:** Working with different data formats (CSV, Excel, etc.) and efficiently loading them into Pandas DataFrames.
*   **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data for analysis.
*   **Data Manipulation and Transformation:** Filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data using Pandas.
*   **Data Analysis and Exploration:** Performing statistical analysis, calculating descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns in data.
*   **Data Visualization:** Creating basic visualizations using Pandas integration with Matplotlib. (Note: More advanced visualizations might be in separate projects or use other libraries like Seaborn.)
*   **Working with Time Series Data (if applicable):** Handling dates and times, performing time-based analysis.

üìÅ Project Structure:

Each project resides in its own dedicated folder within this repository.  A typical project folder includes:

*   `README.md`: This file, providing a detailed description of the project, its purpose, and how to use it.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of project dependencies.
*   Python source code files (`.py` or `.ipynb`): The scripts or notebooks containing the Pandas code.
*   Data files: The datasets used in the project.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/kunal430/pandas_projects.git](https://github.com/kunal430/pandas_projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the desired project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pandas_projects/<project-name>  # Replace <project-name> with the folder name
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv       # Create the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate on Windows
    ```

4.  **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
