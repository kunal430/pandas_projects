# Hotel data analysis (EDA project)
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel data to identify key trends and patterns.  
The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for hotel management and marketing strategies.
## Overview

Looking at how things like the total bill, tip amount, gender, whether someone smokes, the day of the week, time of day, and how many people are in a group affect tipping.

## Data Exploration

The dataset has some helpful info, including:

*   **total_bill:** How much the total bill was.
*   **tip:** How much was tipped.
*   **sex:** The customer's gender.
*   **smoker:** Whether the customer was a smoker.
*   **day:** The day of the week.
*   **time:** Whether it was lunch or dinner.
*   **size:** How many people were in the group.

## Analysis Techniques

To understand the data, I used a few different techniques:

*   **Descriptive statistics:** I calculated things like the average tip, the most common tip amount, and other summary stats to get a feel for the data.
*   **Data visualization:** I made some cool charts and graphs (like `distplot`, `countplot`, `pairplot`, `barplot`, and `violinplot`) to visualize the relationships between different variables and spot any trends.

## Key Findings

Here are some of the interesting things I discovered:

*   **Gender Imbalance:** It looks like there were more male customers than female customers in the dataset.
*   **Strong Correlation:** There's a pretty clear connection between the total bill and the tip amount. The more people spent, the more they tended to tip.
*   **Group Size Matters (a bit):** Larger groups tended to spend more overall, but the relationship wasn't quite as strong as the one between the bill and the tip.
*   **Day-of-the-Week Trends:** Tipping and spending patterns seemed to vary depending on the day of the week.
*   **Gender Differences (maybe):** There were some hints that men and women might have slightly different tipping habits, but it's worth exploring further.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are a few ideas for the restaurant:

*   **Targeted Promotions:** Maybe the restaurant could offer special deals on slower days to boost business.
*   **Incentivize Larger Groups:** They could try to come up with ways to encourage larger groups to dine there.
*   **Staffing Optimization:** Adjusting staffing levels based on the day of the week could be helpful.

## Libraries Used

*   Pandas
*   Seaborn
*   Matplotlib (implicitly, through Pandas visualization)

## Requirements

You'll need the following Python libraries to run this analysis.  It's best to set up a virtual environment first:

1.  ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv       # Create the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # Activate on Windows
    ```

2.  Then, install the requirements:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Where requirements.txt lists pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
    ```
